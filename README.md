# Wroteit
A react and tailwind blog page, similar to reddit, where users can create new posts, create an account, and upvote/downvote posts. Able will be able to create new communities where users can post on specific community pages.

## REMINDER ##
This project is a front-end project, meaning that there is no back-end/serverside to be able to save data. This is strictly just showcasing the use of useState to create new posts/communities, as well as the state of who is currently logged in.

------------

v1: basic front page UI

Page contains basic UI and design, with no functionality. Functionality will include the ability to log in, create posts, and like or dislike other posts.

v3: Updated Nav bar with responsiveness (no functionality in terms of being able to view profile/communities)

Page now allows users to open a nav bar on mobile, where they can access the 'search' option, their profile, as well as their communities that they are subscribed by default.
