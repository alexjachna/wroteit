# Wroteit
A react and tailwind blog page, similar to reddit, where users can create new posts, create an account, and upvote/downvote posts. Able will be able to create new communities where users can post on specific community pages.

## REMINDER ##
This project is a front-end project, meaning that there is no back-end/serverside to be able to save data. This is strictly just showcasing the use of useState to create new posts/communities, as well as the state of who is currently logged in.

------------

v1: basic front page UI

Page contains basic UI and design, with no functionality. Functionality will include the ability to log in, create posts, and like or dislike other posts.

v3: Updated Nav bar with responsiveness (no functionality in terms of being able to view profile/communities)

Page now allows users to open a nav bar on mobile, where they can access the 'search' option, their profile, as well as their communities that they are subscribed by default.

v4: Added raw form of 'login' page

Wroteit now uses react-router-dom to provide the ability to navigate between pages. This will be used to navigate between pages, such as the 'login' page, and the current 'home' page. It will also be used to view a users profile page. EXTREMELY BARE-BONES version of the login page shown below. Will be updated to match the style/theme of the rest of the page.

------------

v5: Added 'update profile' page, and Profile page showcasing users own posts, and profile card

Wroteit now allows users to view their profiles, as well as view their posts they have made. They are also given the ability to change their username, and their bio, to give personality to the account. Currently, the profile page is not responsive, and is currently made for only desktop. Will be fixed in the next version!
